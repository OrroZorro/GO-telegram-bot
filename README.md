#ReadME

This bot can save links sent by users and, upon request, send a random link from the saved ones. It's useful for people who often save many articles but forget to read them :)

The code is written in a way that makes it easily extendable. For example, you can easily add implementations for any other messenger by adding the corresponding client. The rest of the logic will remain unchanged.
